<br>SprayCan Skins Only Work If They Are Tagged As "Spray Can Decal".<br>
The built in workshop editor in rust doesnt allow this so youll need to create the skins by hand.<br>
Then use https://github.com/nihilocrat/SteamWorkshopUploader to upload it.<br><br>
<a href="https://github.com/bmgjet/SkinAndSpay/raw/main/SteamWorkshopUploader.zip" target="_blank">SteamWorkshopUploader.zip</a> is included in this repo and is preset up with 1 skin to use as a template.<br>
Watch the video to see how to use it.<br><br><br>
